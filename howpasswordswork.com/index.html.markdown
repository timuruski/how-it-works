# How Passwords Work

In order for a password to be secure, it must have certain
characteristics. It must be difficult to guess, both for a person and
for a computer. In the past it was assumed a password was most at risk
of being guessed by a person, which resulted in decades of crummy
passwords like this.

memorize. Passwords that cannot be remembered get written down on sticky
notes and stashed near the computer.

This password is difficult for a person to guess because it contains
more than a single word, and the words are selected at random. This also
makes it difficult for a computer to guess for the same reasons.
