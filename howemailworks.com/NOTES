## A more detailed explanation

Your phone number and home address are used by the government to contact 
you for important information.

If you think of an email like a letter, the username is the name of the
person printed on the envelope and the server name is the address of the
building the letter is to be delivered to. Just as multiple people can
live at a single address, multiple people can receive email through the
same server. And just as you can receive mail at both your home and work
address, you can receive email through multiple servers.

An email address is one of the most important parts of using the
Internet. More important than having a blog, or using Facebook or
Twitter, or having the Internet in your pocket. With an email address
you have a passport to virtually anything on the web.
