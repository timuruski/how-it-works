# How Email Works


## Why email is so important

Your email address is the most important you own on the internet.  With
an email address you can access Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. It allows
you to correspond with people around the world, receieve documents and
pictures. and most importantly reset the password for any website on the
internet.

It's important to understand how your email address works. It is no less
important than knowing your home address or your phone number. You only 
need a single email address to get around, but it's important that you 
protect it.



## Anatomy of an email address

An email address has two parts. A user name and a server name.

    alice@example.com

You can think of it like the address on an envelope. The first part, the
user name, is who the letter is addressed to. The second part, the
server name, is like the address of the building.

This analogy carries well. Many people can occupy the same building,
either a house with a single family or an office building with hundreds
of people inside. You can also receive mail at more than one building,
your home or your place of business.


## A more detailed explanation




---


Your phone number and home address are used by the government to contact 
you for important information.

If you think of an email like a letter, the username is the name of the
person printed on the envelope and the server name is the address of the
building the letter is to be delivered to. Just as multiple people can
live at a single address, multiple people can receive email through the
same server. And just as you can receive mail at both your home and work
address, you can receive email through multiple servers.

An email address is one of the most important parts of using the
Internet. More important than having a blog, or using Facebook or
Twitter, or having the Internet in your pocket. With an email address
you have a passport to virtually anything on the web.
